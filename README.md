# Ivy Wallet (Maintained Fork)

> A modern, open-source personal finance app for Android.

This is a **personally-maintained fork** of the original [Ivy Wallet](https://github.com/Ivy-Apps/ivy-wallet), which has been archived by the original developers.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Why this fork exists

I use Ivy Wallet as my **daily driver** for managing my finances, and I genuinely love the simplicity and design of this app. Since the original project was archived, I'm maintaining this fork to:

- Keep the app up-to-date and usable on newer Android versions
- Fix bugs and enhance stability
- Potentially introduce small improvements while keeping the original vision intact

Maintaining this fork ensures that I â€” and anyone else who enjoys Ivy Wallet â€” can continue to use it for the foreseeable future.

## âœ… Current status

This fork is under active maintenance. While I am the sole maintainer at the moment, contributions, suggestions, and bug reports are very welcome!
